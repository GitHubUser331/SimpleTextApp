# SimpleTextApp
An HTML and NodeJS server template to create a simple texting app.

## Use

To create a simple texting app, you can use the HTML and NodeJS server template provided here.

### Getting Started

First of all, download the repository by either cloning it or pressing the green code button, then clicking on 'Download ZIP' to download the source code.

Clone the repository using:

```bash
$ git clone https://githubuser331/simpletextapp/
```

Now, you can customize the **_textapp.html_** file, with the **_server.js_** file as per your choice.


### NOTE: Before we start setting up the server, ensure you have NodeJS and WebSocket both installed on your device.


### Setting up NodeJS server on Windows



- Open command prompt in the repository folder/directory where the **_server.js_** file is present.

- Type ``` node server.js ```and press enter.

It should show a message that the websocket server is successfully started on a port (default is 3000).

- Now, open the **_textapp.html_** file in browser (on any device), and *enter the IP address of the device, on which the NodeJS server is hosted.*

- Press connect, and it should connect to the server.

- You may need to connect to the same wifi network on which the server is hosted. 

_For example, if the server is hosted on a device connected to a wifi network with IP address **192.168.1.1**, you should enter the **same IP address** and port (if needed) to connecf to the server._


### Setting up NodeJS server on Linux/Mac/Android/Other


The instructions are the same as Windows, you just need to follow the steps on your respective OS. The steps may vary for different Operating Systems.

**For Android**, Use the <a href="https://termux.dev">Termux</a> app to run the server through the command line interface.

**For Other OSes**, kindly refer to the installation steps on your respective OS.
